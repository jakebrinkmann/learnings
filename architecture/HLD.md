A **High-Level Design** (HLD) document provides a strategic overview of a software solution’s architecture, enabling stakeholders to understand, evaluate, and approve the proposed system before detailed development begins. ￼

# Supporting Arguments

- **Purpose of HLD**: Offers a bird’s-eye view of the system architecture, aligning technical solutions with business objectives.
- **Timing**: Developed during the Analysis phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to inform decision-making and planning.
- **Audience**: Tailored for non-technical stakeholders, such as project sponsors and senior management, to facilitate understanding and approval.
- **Contents**: Includes solution descriptions, requirement references, architecture diagrams, logical breakdowns, business processes, data flows, and various representations to illustrate the system comprehensively. ￼ ￼

# Detailed Insights

- **When HLD is Needed**: Essential for large-scale IT projects, especially those involving system integration, where understanding the overall architecture is crucial before delving into detailed designs.
- **Why Not Jump to LLD**: Low-Level Design (LLD) is more detailed and resource-intensive; initiating it without stakeholder approval of the HLD can lead to wasted efforts if significant changes are required.
- **Ownership**: Typically authored by Solution Architects who possess a deep understanding of both the business domain and technical landscape, ensuring the design meets all necessary requirements and constraints.
- **Agile Considerations**: While Agile methodologies often deprioritize extensive documentation, HLDs remain valuable in complex projects where upfront architectural clarity is necessary.
