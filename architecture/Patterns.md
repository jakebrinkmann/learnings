- Creational Patterns
  - Abstract Factory
  - Builder
  - Factory Method
  - Prototype
  - Singleton
- Structural Patterns
  - Adapter: allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
  - Bridge: lets you split large (or set of closely related) classes into two separate hierarchies
  - Composite: lets you compose objects into tree structures
  - Decorator: lets you attach new behaviors to objects
  - Facade: provides a simplified interface to a library
  - Flyweight: sharing common parts of state between multiple objects
  - Proxy: provide a substitute or placeholder for another object (controls access)
- Behavioral Patterns
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - Command
  - Iterator
  - Mediator
  - Memento
