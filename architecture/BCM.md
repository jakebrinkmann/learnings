# BCM to Technical Roadmap

## Executive Strategy → Business Capability Model (BCM) → Technical Roadmap

---

### Business Capability

- Defines what an organization does
- Focuses on stable, unique things
- NOT the process (how) or the people (who)
- Independent of current or future systems
- **Capabilities ≠ Functions or Processes**: A capability is everything it takes to deliver a business outcome — people, processes, tools, relationships, culture, and governance.
- **Modeling Capabilities** helps visualize and assess what exists, what’s missing, and what needs improvement.
- **Decomposition**: Capabilities can be broken down into sub-capabilities.

### Capability Lifecycle

- Capabilities go through a lifecycle: Identify → Assess → Acquire → Deploy → Sustain

### Core vs. Edge Capabilities

- **Core Capabilities**: Stable, focused on operational excellence, governed for cost-effectiveness.
- **Edge Capabilities**: Dynamic, focused on innovation, governed for strategic value.

### MECE: Mutually Exclusive & Collectively Exhaustive

- No overlaps, no gaps
- Clarifies ownership
- Every function maps to one capability
- Technology may change, but capabilities remain constant (Anchor)

### Strategic Domain Driven Design

- BCM informs software design
- Well-defined capabilities map to bounded contexts
- Aligns software structure with stable business concepts

### From BCM to IT Operations

- Use CMDB to map:
  - Business Capability → Business Process → Applications → Services → Assets & Configuration Items
- Assign Tiered Classifications and SLA Bundles to services based on business criticality.

### Speaking Business Language

- BCM shifts focus to investment management by capability
- Enables cost transparency (true cost/TCO)
- Technology Business Management (TBM) by capability

### Data, Views, and Heatmaps

- Layer strategic importance and maturity
  - **Maturity Level**: (e.g., Initial, Managed, Defined, Optimized)
- Identify market differentiators
- Cover basic table stakes
- Build financially grounded arguments for modernization

### From Tech Debt to Strategic Investment

- Avoid risk (cost of not fixing, downtime, breaches)
- Quantify avoided negatives to build a full business case
