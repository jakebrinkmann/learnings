- The [Architecture Decision Records](https://aws.github.io/jsii/decisions/introduction) contains the log of all architectural decisions made while developing the _jsii_ project.

In short, the Y-statement is as follows:

> In the context of <use case/user story u>, 
> facing <concern_ c> we decided for <option_ o> to achieve <quality_ q>,
> accepting <downside_ d>.

 1. Are we confident enough that this design will work (Evidence)?
 2. Have we decided between at least two options, and compared them (semi-)systematically (Criteria)?
 3. Have we discussed among each other and with peers just enough and come to a common view (Agreement)?
 4. Have we captured the decision outcome and shared the decision record (Documentation)?
 5. Do we know when to realize, review and possibly revise this decision (Realization/review)?

# Y-Statement:
  In the context of <use case/component>,
  facing <concern>,
  we decided for <option1>,
  and neglected <option2, ... oN>,
  to achieve <quality>,
  accepting downside <consequence>
