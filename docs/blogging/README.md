# Blogging

Strategies for sharing information with the global community.

## Community

* [meta-knowledge](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge) - many people are aggregating their knowledge and sharing it online as a Github (gitbooks.io) repo

## Blogging Tools

### Static Site Generators

* [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org) - meant for documentation, this great tool converts markdown into fully-routed sites, without the need to pre-generate the pages. It dynamically generates the pages on the fly by reading static markdown files from a github repo.
