## Part 1: Mechanics

> Teams have long struggled with building high-quality software that **remains** high quality over time

> the problems of policing all the various moving parts in complex software, and the dynamic nature of the software development ecosystem

> ❌ Teams that attempt **manual** governance eventually become overwhelmed

> 🟩 The entire scope of software architecture encompasses requirements *plus* architecture characteristics: the "-ilities" of software

> Architectural decisions are ones in which each choice offers significant trade-offs.

> **An evolutionary software architecture supports guided, incremental change across multiple dimensions**

> A **fitness function** is an objective function used to summarize how close a prospective design solution is to achieving the set aims... while making the basis for those decisions explicit and testable.

> 💜 There are no separate systems. The world is a continuum. Where to draw a boundary around a system depends on the purpose of the discussion.
> -- Donella H. Meadows

> 🟩 perspectives forms a *dimension* of the architecture -- an intentional partitioning of the parts supporting a particular perspective.

> **Software Architecture**: The parts that are hard to change later.

> What if we build changeability _into_ the architecture? ... if _ease of change_ is a bedrock principle

> _evolvability_ is a meta-characteristic, an architectural wrapper that protects all the other architectural characteristics

> ❌ not ones that have been patched and adapted into increasingly incomprehensible accidental complexity

> 🟩 purpose of agile architectures isn't __no architecture__, it's __no USELESS architecture__. Don't go through bureaucratic processes that don't add value

> it's often not the easy _simple_ vs _complex_ system distinction, but rather systems that are complex in different ways.

> 🟩 sophisticated systems require purposeful design.
