# ABCDE Method

- [Eat that Frog & The ABCDE Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKOMTZ7PPLg&feature=share)

Method to set daily priorities.

1. Begin with a list of all your daily tasks.
    - Identify THREE critical tasks that offer the MOST value and contribution to you or your company.
    - If done all day, provide greatest value
2. Label each task with an `A, B, C, D, or E`
3. A, the essential task must be done today.
    - There can be more than 1 A job, but again, prioritize these as A1, A2, A3, ...
4. Tasks labeled B, C, D, or E are to be dealt with only once all A tasks are completed.
    - These tasks are not your priority.


- A: Your most important task: the frog
- B: Your next most important tasks.
- C: Tasks with no consequences.
- D: Tasks you can delegate.
- E: Tasks you can eliminate.

It’s critical to plan every day in advance and always work from a list.
You’ll start macro with a master list, and then break it down into more granular monthly lists, weekly lists, and daily lists.

| Task   | Deadline   | >> | Priorty   | Daily task    |
| ...    | ...        | >> | A         | Focus on this |


        **NEVER WORK ON SOMETHING THAT DIDNT START ON MASTER LIST**

Imagine sudden emergency (leaving tomorrow for 1 month):
- What would have dire impact?
- What key results keep us "alive"?
- What would be **FATAL**?
- What is just uncomfortable?
