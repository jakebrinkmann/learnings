# Grooming

* ⭐ `*` **Ready**: team agrees with assignee that ticket is clearly defined
* 🔼 `**` **Follows**: can be done, but needs to happen after something else
* ❓ `?` **Waiting**: questions need answering before work can start
* ♻ `?*` **Review**: assignee has updated this ticket
* 💥 `!` **Blocked**: something outside our control has/will stop progress


# Definition of Done

* Coded
* Integrated
* Documented
* All Tests Pass
