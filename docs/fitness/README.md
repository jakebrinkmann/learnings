##### [Dr. Rhonda Patrick on The Joe Rogan Experience](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-joe-rogan-experience/id360084272?mt=2&i=1000397707330)

* **Rhonda**: Exercise increase uptake of serotonin into the brain
* Running frame of mind is similar to a state of day-dreaming (good kind, reflection; not bad-kind spaced out) improving clarity when handling stress
* **Joe**: High-intensity up-hill trail runs once a week helps other area of cardio stamina, and trains muscles not used in other exercises (able to run in the morning, and still kick-box at night)
* **Rhonda**: Prevent bladder problems strengthen pelvic floor with kegels
* The group setting in spin-class helps push it, feeding off the group via "they keep going, so can I"
* Human aerobic capacity decreases 1% every year, but after 8 weeks of high-intensity training brings back 10% (a decade)
* Have to run outside for day-dream state, treadmill doesn't work
* Walking in nature improves not just psychologically but also other bio markers
* **Joe**: Hindu squats are great to strengthen knees
* Suggests better shoes, Nike changed how people run landing on big cushy heel
