##### [Arnold Schwarzenegger on The Tim Ferris Show](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-tim-ferriss-show/id863897795?mt=2&i=1000334626780)

* **Arnold**: Many things going really well, a lot was happening, lead to anxiety; Was combining everything into one big problem
* Transcendental meditation helped to separate focus
* Would work for 45 minutes then play chess for 15; Feel fresh like haven't already worked that day
