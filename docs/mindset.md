# Mindset

Any sustainable ways to stay positive and achieve life goals.


## Quotes

* Life is 10% of what happens to you, and 90% of how YOU react to it
* Growth is a long term game, and the crappy days are more important
* If life shuts a door, open it again. It's a door, that's how they work
* The best way to predict the future is to create it
* A river cuts through rocks, not because of its power, but because of its persistence
* Failure and success live next door to each other and they have no numbers at the door. You just knock.
* Courage does not always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying "I will try again tomorrow"

* **Arnold**: Many things going really well, a lot was happening, lead to anxiety; Was combining everything into one big problem
* Transcendental meditation helped to separate focus
* Would work for 45 minutes then play chess for 15; Feel fresh like haven't already worked that day
