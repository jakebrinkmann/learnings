* To make "Sole Brine" (so-lay salt water): fill a jar (non-metallic) 1/3 with Pink Himalayan Salt
* Himalayan salt has more nutrients, but I use Italian Sea Salt, it's what was in my cupboard, just needs to be natural/unprocessed
* Fill the jar almost to the top with clean, filtered water, shake it up
* Leave on the counter over-night, add more salt until no more will dissolve, meaning full salinity
* For 1-week cleanse, drink 3-tbsp of brine every morning
* For daily hydration and blood-pressure help, drink 1-tbsp daily
* Recommend combining with at least 16-32oz of water, unless you like it salty
* Salt is a natural preservative, and the Sole Brine will keep on the counter indefinitely
