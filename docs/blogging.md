# Blogging

Strategies for sharing information with the global community.

## Community

* [meta-knowledge](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge) - many people are aggregating their knowledge and sharing it online as a Github (gitbooks.io) repo.

## Blogging Tools

* [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org) - meant for documentation, converts markdown into fully-routed sites, dynamically generated on the fly by reading static markdown files from a github repo.

* [ghostwriter](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/) - my favorite cross-platform, distraction-free markdown editor.
