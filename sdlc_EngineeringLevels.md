# Tracks
The engineering career path is composed initially of the main track, common to everyone and that later bisects into two distinct tracks: individual contributor (IC), and management.

# Individual Contributor (IC)
An individual contributor is someone who works towards delivering the highest impact possible in the product through their own work. Even though an individual contributor's value is through deliverables it is also expected of an IC to greatly empower others through knowledge sharing and planning.

# People Management
The people management track focuses on leading people and working together to deliver value as a workgroup. In this track your contributions will gradually shift towards empowering the people, optimizing the different value streams and the people that are involved with them.
