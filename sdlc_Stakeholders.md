# Stakeholders
The stakeholders in an Agile development project can include a wide variety of individuals, all of whom are materially affected by the outcome of the product or products being developed. They might be:
  - Those funding the project
  - Senior managers
  - Portfolio managers
  - Supervisors
  - Operations staff
  - Direct end users
  - Indirect users

Stakeholders can also include developers who are working on other products that integrate or interact in some way with the software being developed as part of the project, as well as support and maintenance staff that might be affected by the development or deployment of the software.


## Product Owner

The product owner (or product manager), a representative of the organization that is buying or acquiring the software being developed.
The voice of the customer and therefore plays a major role in ensuring the success of the project.

> It’s critical for the product owner to have the skills to communicate with the dev team so all requirements are clearly understood.
> If communication fails, the project is likely doomed, and the customer won’t be happy.

Responsibilities might include:
  - Demonstrating software programs to key stakeholders
  - Communicating project status
  - Organizing reviews
  - Educating stakeholders about the development process
