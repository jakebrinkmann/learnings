# Software Design (Hammock)
Features are results, not objectives

1. First, you have to understand the problem.
2. After understanding, make a plan.
3. Carry out the plan.
4. Look back on your work. How could it be better?

Understand the Problem
  - Waking Mind: Critical Thinking
  - FEEDS
  - Background Mind: Connecting Abstracts

What do you know?
  - Facts, context, constraints

What don't you know?
  - questions? (who knows everything?!)

Are there related problems?
  - Look in and around your space
  - Look critically at other solutions

Solution Tradeoffs
  - find problems and solve those too
  - Enumerate two or more possible solutions
    - Attributes / Deficits of each
    - 7 +/- 2 components

Try it
  - Coding, type sparingly, with confidence
  - Feedback loop is important
