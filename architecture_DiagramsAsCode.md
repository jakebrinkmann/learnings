# magic number 7

Miller's Law: Remember the rule of Seven, Plus or Minus Two - limit the number of objects on your diagrams from 5 to 9!

1. Imagine that you are producing a diagram that must pass this test: you will finish the DFD, then hand it to someone (of reasonable intelligence) who will then proceed to describe the process back to you based upon what he or she sees in your diagram. 

2. If this process recitation captures your original process description (and, of course, the appropriate characteristics of the business process itself), your DFD is reasonably accurate.
