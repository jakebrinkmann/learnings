    | Leverage     | Neutral    | Overhead   |
    |--------------|------------|------------|
    | ~10x         | ~1x        | 0.1x       |
    | Do **great** | Do **good* | Do **bad** |


1: Brute force works early on. Then it stops working.
    - at higher scope, it is impossible to maintain the samkje degree of impact you had earlier—there’s simply a lot more to do.

2: A calendar speaks more truth than a to-do list.
    - Your to-do list is the ideal Sunday evening theory.
    - Your calendar is the brutal Monday to Friday practice.

```
    Limit meetings
    ⇒ Long scheduled work blocks

    At end of the work day, plan next day
    ⇒ Easier to disconnect, be present

    Fit the next day's tasks in calendar
    ⇒ Forces prioritizing

    Plan next week on Friday evening
    ⇒ Go into weekend with a clear mind
```


3: All your tasks are not created equal. Doing great work doesn't mean that you put in your best effort for every task

4: Understand the dangers of Proof of Worth tasks. If you do them, do them sparingly and intentionally.
    many company cultures make it necessary to perform non-core tasks just to show that they deserve to be in the room.


5: The Eisenhower Matrix will stop working for you at some point. Then, it is time to learn & practice Radical Delegation.


6: As a senior, you provide the greatest leverage to your team & your company via your insight.
    Whether it is customer insight, domain insight, creative insight, execution insight, distribution insight, it is *vital* that you make time for insight.

    2) Change place. work from a coworking space or a coffee shop, to trick your brain into focusing.

    ROI = (Value created — Cost of your time) ÷ Cost of your time

    Opportunity Cost = Value of optimal option – Value of chosen option


How many things did you say no to?
Focus means: Saying no to something you think is a phenomenal idea
