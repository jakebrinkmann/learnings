    - For instance, address a risk, test an assumption, or deliver a feature. -->
# 🔨 Method

    - List your high level ideas for possible solutions -->
  - Which artifact, validation technique and test group are used?
    - For instance, paper prototype, spike, shippable product increment; product demo, usability test, A/B test; users, customers and/or internal stakeholders. -->
# 📊 Metrics
  - How do you determine if the goal has been met?
  - Understand if and to which extent you have met the goal.
