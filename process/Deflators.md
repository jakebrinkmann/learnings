"Bad Smells"

provide early warning signals ("bad smells")
    - Customers are typically happy during early iterations but later begin to complain about many things from all iterations. The customer needs to be coached to provide early and honest feedback.
    - Programmers are typically not sure of how functionality works together. Large complex systems require a good metaphor or overview
    - Everyone claims the story cards are finished, yet it requires weeks of full-time development to deliver a quality application. The solution is to create a precise list of tasks that must be completed before a story is finished, and make sure programmers adhere to the rules. Do not rush to complete them and cut corners with refactoring or testing

    - You do not need as much documentation as you think. Create only documentation that was useful and needed.
    - Communication is critical. Less documentation led to greater communication.
    - Modeling tools are not as useful as you think.
    - You need a variety of modeling techniques in your toolkit.
    - Big up-front design is not required.
    - Reuse the wheel, do not reinvent it.

# "The Scrum Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems."

people have a tendency to treat the Daily Stand-up as simply individual reporting. "I did this . . . I’ll do that"—then on to the next person.

- For experienced practitioners, when things go wrong with [scrum ceremonies], they will instinctively know what to adjust to fix the situation.
- For novices, when things go wrong, it is much less likely that they'll figure out what to do... and it’s much more likely that, given no assistance, they will simply abandon the practice altogether.
- This would be unfortunate since well-run [scrum ceremonies] add significant value to teams.
- In order to address this, it is important to make explicit the benefits and consequences of common practices for [scrum ceremonies]. These patterns of [scrum ceremonies] can help less experienced practitioners as well as remind more experienced practitioners of the reasons behind their intuition.

# "Tell the headline, not the whole story"

Some people are talkative and tend to wander off into Story Telling. Instead of providing a brief description of an issue, the participant provides enough details and context to cause others to tune out.

Some people want to engage in Problem Solving immediately after hearing a problem. Meetings that take too long tend to have low energy and participants not directly related to a long discussion will tend to be distracted. (It’s a time to raise issues and surface ideas, not a time for in-depth problem-solving.)

# Two Hand Rule:

...if anyone thinks the current conversation has gone off topic, or is no longer effective, then they raise a hand. Once a second person raises a hand then that’s a sign to stop the conversation and continue with the rest of the [scrum ceremonies]. Those speaking can continue the conversation after the stand up has finished.

Use a simple and consistent phrase like "Take It Offline"... ensure that the right people are nominated or sign up to deal with the issue later.

Having the facilitator decide who should speak first is a subtle though definite force against self-organisation.

When the Scrum Master isn't part of 'the circle', the team members really have to talk to each other to discuss the progress.

With simple, predictable ordering mechanisms, it is very easy for participants to ignore other speakers until it is closer to their turn.

Another issue with the conventional format is that tasks or workstreams aren't discussed coherently; instead, each subject comes up briefly depending on the order in which team members speak. This can make it hard to tell what's really going on.
