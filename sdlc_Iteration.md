INPUTS -> ACTIVITY -> OUTCOME

    - (Stakeholder Feedback, Funding, Vision, Priorities (value/risk)) -> Release Planning [Product Owner] -> Product/Release/Features Backlog Items (PBI), Release Goal (RG)
    - (Improvements, PBI, RG, 3-Avg-Velocity, Availability) -> Iteration Planning -> Sprint Forecast, Flexible Scope, Delivery Commitment, Sprint Backlog (SB)
    - (Forecast, SB) -> Daily Planning [Dev Team] (reports to each other) -> SB, Accelerate/Declerate Velocity, Assignment Volunteers, Potentially Shippable Increment (PSI)
    - (PBI) -> Backlog Refinement -> Definition of Done, Story Points
    - (RG, Release Burndown) -> Sprint Review -> Velocity, Sprint Score
    - (PSI) -> Product Demo -> Stakeholder Feedback, Release Dates [Product Owner]
    - (Scrum Flow) -> Retrospective (inspect, adapt) -> Improvements

Process steps should be logical and their worth immediately obvious to each team member.
  ‘Process pride’ can keep the real work from happening.
  Good processes move to the background so the team members can focus on results

The more frequently you can deliver running, tested slices of the system, the more you can reduce the reliance on written ‘promissory’ notes and improve the likelihood of delivering the system

The previous contractor had spent two years producing over 3,500 pages of documentation but no code. Deliver an 80 percent solution today instead of 100 percent solution tomorrow

Travel light: Create just enough models and documents to get by. Determine "how much is enough" of each artifact.

    - pre-sprint planning: identifies a Sprint Goal reminding developers why the tasks are being performed and at which level of detail to implement them (Divide work into tasks small enough to finish in a day)
    - sprint: Upon completion of the pre-sprint planning, teams are handed their sprint backlog and "told to sprint to achieve their objectives"
    - scrum meetings: enhance communication, identify any problems encountered, and keep the entire team focused on a common goal.
    - post-sprint meeting: analyze project progress and demonstrate the current system
