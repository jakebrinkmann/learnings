Agile without proper test automation is dead
  - Pick what was tested that needs to be automated,
  - So just increasing the number of automated tests
  - Automated regression testing happens during sprint; until system/performance testing

Estimate with T-shirt sizing should include dev/testing.

Who owns testing? Unit tests is devs. Functional tests with dev/stakeholder. Automation of tests, devs can, GWT/BDD.

End-to-end testing, performance testing, outside developers.

Modified waterfall model
  - Requirements :: Analysis
  - Design :: Checking
  - Implementation :: Unit Testing
  - Integration :: System Testing
  - Maintenance :: Regression Testing

What kind of tests?
  - Programmer tests / non-programmer tests
  - Developer / Tester
  - Unit tests / Integration tests / Functional tests / System tests
  - Automated tests / Manual tests
  - Regression tests
  - Exploratory testing
