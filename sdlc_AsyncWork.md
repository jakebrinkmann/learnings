> It's more important to be productive than to look productive.

Here are the 8 core principles

1. Start with Clarity
2. Always Default to Action
3. Understand Urgent vs. Important
4. Write with Intention
5. Communicate Everything Upfront
6. Value Results Over Responsiveness
7. Batch Tasks
8. Pass the Baton

  - What you're responsible for
  - The priority order
  - How you'll get them done
  - Where you'll go to find answers when you're stuck

Instead of approaching it like a strict recipe that has to happen in 1-2-3 order, consider what can be done in parallel.

One technique is to provide an "if-then" response. Instead of saying "Try this", say "Try this, if this happens, then try that".

- Answer questions in the morning to unblock team members.
- Anything longer than 5 min goes in your task backlog.
- Give a quick update at the end of the day on what you did, what's next, and blockers/questions.
- Then the cycle repeats. Keep the baton in motion.
