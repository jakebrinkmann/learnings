# IDEAL - Problem Solving Process

  - I - Identify | Identify the problem
  - D - Define | Define the cause
  - E - Explore | Explore possible strategies
  - A - Action | Act
  - L - Look Back | Look and learn

There are four basic steps in solving a problem:
  1. Conceptualization | Defining the problem | Identify the issue | Analyze contributing factors | Understanding the problem
  2. Ideation | Generating alternatives | Generate Interventions | Researching the available options | Identify different aspects
  3. Evaluation | Evaluating and selecting alternatives | Evaluate Solutions | Select an option or options
  4. Implementation | Implementing solutions | Implement a Plan | Taking actions


# Double Diamond (design process model)

- exploring an issue more widely or deeply (divergent thinking) 
- then, taking focused action (convergent thinking)

Divided into four distinct phases: 
- In each stage, designers:
  - **Discover**:  seek to understand the problem; gather insights about who will be using the product or service; Research, Interviews, and Observation.
      — Market research 
      — User research 
      — Managing information 
      — Design research groups.
  - **Define**:  synthesize information gathered; define the problem; Create a clear problem statement that captures the user needs and goals.
      — Project development 
      — Project management 
      — Project sign-off.
  - **Develop**:  generate a range of possible solutions. Create prototypes, test them with users, gather feedback, refine solutions.
      — Multi-disciplinary working 
      — Visual management 
      — Development methods 
      — Testing.
  - **Deliver**:  select the best solution and develop into final product or service. Create detailed specifications, work to bring the product or service to market.
      — Final testing, approval and launch 
      — Targets, evaluation and feedback loop
